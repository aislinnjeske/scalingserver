# Scalable Server Design: Using Thread Pools & Micro Batching to Manage and Load Balance Active Network Connections

This project develops a server to handle network traffic by designing and building my own thread pool. This thread pool 
has a configurable number of threads that are used to perform tasks relating to network communications. 
Specifically, I use this thread pool to manage all tasks relating to network communications. 

This includes:
1. Managing incoming network connections
2. Receiving data over these network connections
3. Organizing data into batches to improve performance
4. Sending data over any of these links
